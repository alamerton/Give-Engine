JESMOND POOL AND GYM
Welcome to Jesmond Pool and Gym, an award winning social enterprise operating as a charity since our reopening in 1992. We are dedicated to working to promote health and fitness in the community across all ages from children and students through to older adults and work with local GPs to facilitate access to our activities and classes.
In our 22m pool we offer lane and family swimming sessions, aqua fit classes, Masters sessions, pool parties, mermaid experiences and chill out sessions. Jesmond Aqua School offers private and group swimming lessons for children and adults. We deliver RLSS accredited lifeguard courses on a regular basis.
In addition to the pool, we have 2 gyms ‘The Basement Gym’ and ‘The Poolside Gym’. The Basement gym houses a variety of different equipment from a range of cardiovascular equipment and weight stack machines to free weight bars and dumbbells.
The Poolside Gym was refurbished in 2019 with all new hi-tech equipment including cardiovascular equipment , weight stack machines and even a sledge. Our in house personal trainer can provide guided sessions in the gyms and our expert in exercise for older adults runs dedicated sessions for the over 50s.















In our upstairs activity room, we run a range of different exercise classes delivered by expert teachers many of which moved online during lockdown. From children’s dance classes to Tai Chi we hope to cater for all tastes. In addition the Jesmond Joggers run out of the pool providing a collegiate group for keen runners around the community. The activity room also hosts a variety of other activities including childrens’ parties
Jala Therapies, hosted in the pool building, provides a range of massage and relaxation treatments.
Follow us on Facebook for regular updates and sign up to our newsletter for information direct to your inbox.



























WHAT OUR MEMBERS SAY






“Re the pool generally – the current system for adult swimming is excellent and the staff have really been on top of it since the very start – I have been telling everyone I know how good it is.
I also know that some of my fellow swimmers are coming from Durham/Middlesborough/Heydon Bridge because their council (or other) run pools are not open. Like Jesmond Library, Jesmond Pool & Gym is very much at the leading edge – we are lucky to have it!”
Jesmond Pool






We love your pool!!! The staff are awesome too!

Quality of life to the end of life, for our community




St David’s Hospice Care is a charitable organisation providing comprehensive, palliative care to patients, their families and carers facing life-limiting illnesses.
We provide a large range of expert services offering care and support and specialise in pain relief and symptom control to help people live and have the best quality of life possible. Our services are delivered from the comfort of our patient's homes or our purpose built in-patient hospice. We believe everyone should have access to high quality and compassionate palliative and end of life care, where and whenever they need it. These services are free of charge.
From our first year of operation, when we cared for six patients, St. David’s has grown to become one of the UK’s largest provider of hospice at home care, caring for over 3,200 patients and families every year, serving communities in South East Wales (Newport, Caerphilly, Torfaen, Monmouthshire, as well as Mid and South Powys.)

The HEULWEN TRUSTIs a charity that offers people who are less abled free trips along the canal in Welshpool. Heulwen means sunshine in Welsh and the Trust hopes to bring a glimmer of sunshine into the lives of people who suffer with a problem whether of the body or of the mind.Open For BookingsWe are pleased to be able to provide once more, our peaceful and much loved canal trips, for you to enjoy from the safety of our spacious cabins and open topped front sections. If you are, or know someone who is in need of a safe, relaxing day out, head to our booking page or get in touch.Welshpool Country Music Festival 2023
The Festival is on-track to go ahead this year!Welshpool Country Music Festival will be running July 14-17, the gates will be open at noon on the 13th and closed for noon 17th.


The Welshpool Country Music Festival is a fund raising event, brought to you by the Heulwen Trust which is a Charity dedicated to providing free boat trips for those who are less abled than most.
 Due to the recent pandemic, we have regretfully had to close our doors to the many who looked forward to our festival in 2020 and 2021, removing our primary source of funding.

Our largest expense is keeping our canal boats water-worthy, which is what the music festival aims to pay for every year, so that we can continue to provide a little sunshine to vulnerable and less abled adults and children in the form of exciting, scenic canal boat trips through some of the most beautiful Welsh countryside.

Since the decision to postpone the festival, we have received overwhelming feedback from our amazing festival-goers requesting a simple way to help out with what we do - we have opened a JustGiving campaign as a gateway to provide just that.

With Gift Aid, your generous donation of £10 would be worth £12.50 at no extra cost to you.

Yes, I want to Gift Aid any donations made to NAM now, in the future and in the past four years

I am a UK taxpayer and I understand that if I pay less Income and /or Capital Gains Tax than the amount of Gift Aid claimed on all my donations in the relevant tax year, it is my responsibility to pay any difference.






In our 35th year we’re asking people to donate £35 – that’s just £1 for every year we’ve been providing life-changing information. Any donation you make helps us continue our work towards a world where HIV is no longer a threat to health or happiness.

£5 allows us to reach millions of people globally with accurate and reliable resources about HIV prevention and treatment.
£10 helps us produce news and bulletins on the latest developments in HIV for healthcare staff around the world.
£35 means we can empower more people living with HIV to challenge stigma with our information workshops, videos and broadcasts.

Developing Talent
Israel Opera has created the Meitar Opera Studio, a unique, world-renowned school for young opera singers that needs funds to help the next generation of opera stars to flourish.



Reaching Out
Year-round, Israel Opera is determined to reach people right across Israeli society, all ages, origins, cultures, and ethnic backgrounds. Visits are organised to groups such as Arab Israelis, Druze, and Israeli Christians. It values enormously the opportunity to celebrate, through the medium of song, the multicultural and diverse mosaic that makes up the modern state of Israel.



Fostering a Love of Opera
Through creative educational programmes, especially catering to the needs of school children, the opera company is ensuring young people encounter opera. These experiences are transformative.




The Israel Opera needs its friends to help deliver its ambitious vision . . .

	Learning, thriving and achieving as a school family through God’s love.	
“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” (Jeremiah 29 v11)

	Headteacher's message	



As Executive Headteacher of Ilam School, I am proud and privileged to welcome you to our school.
We are a small, caring and happy church school in the beautiful village of Ilam. I am delighted to be the Headteacher here as we have the most amazing children who love coming to school and enjoy their learning from nursery to the time they leave us at the end of year six.
We are lucky enough to have a team of hardworking, passionate and thoughtful teachers and teaching assistants who strive to ensure that teaching and learning is of a high quality, varied, challenging and fun. We actively use our outdoor surroundings to engage our pupils through weekly Forest School lessons.
At Ilam, we believe that primary education is more than just academic achievement. We aim to develop a love of learning for all our children and build firm foundations to enable them to be successful and happy.
We are also excited to announce that Ilam School is currently in the process of converting to become an Academy, and will be joining the QEGSMAT.
If you would like to visit our school, please do contact the school office and I look forward showing you around and answering any questions you may have.
Mrs Rachel Linton

Fundraising

Fundraising is vital to Cherry Lodge Cancer Care. Without it, we would not be able to offer free services to all our members. We raise funds in numerous ways, including putting on our own varied programme of fundraising events and helping others to raise funds for us.
Support our Future Events 



Volunteering

Volunteer support is at the heart of the Cherry Lodge Centre and at the heart of the services we provide. We value the time given by all our volunteers in helping us to achieve our mission to support people living with cancer, their family, friends and carers.

Established by parents in 1986, Families in Care has been a registered charity since 1992 and is firmly recognised as a professional organisation by the Judiciary and Child Care professionals across Tyneside.

Emerging out of parents own identified needs, from the very beginning Families in Care has been placing parents at the heart of the service. Creating a service delivery model that is nurturing, non-judgemental, holistic and most importantly in partnership with birth parents it has drawn from expertise delivered by parents, practitioners and other professionals. Over the years, Families in Care has developed a unique service, providing free specialist advocacy, counselling, wellbeing and education for birth parents and high quality training opportunities for law and social work students at all levels.Welcome to Families in Care. 
“I have the highest regard for Families in Care; they have been immeasurably helpful not only to clients of mine but to parents and other family members where, say my involvement was as a solicitor for the child or children.”
                                                               
                                                                                       Family Solicitor
Why we do it
​​
The simple answer is - because people tell us that they need our service.
 
And because we are passionate about it.
 
Parents and grandparents involved in complex child protection proceedings tell us that too often they find the process overwhelming, stressful, scary and difficult to understand. Families in Care works to reduce the stress and distress experienced by birth families involved with Child Protection Services; ensuring that vulnerable families are informed, included and supported.
 
As stressed by Family Rights Group, helping parents to understand their rights and choices they have supports the process of partnership working between them and local authorities, meaning better engagement and improved chances for children. While working with parents and other family members, we are playing our full part in safeguarding and working together to meet the needs of vulnerable children.
           (Working Together to Safeguard Children Guidance, 2013)
 
 
 
 
 
 
What we do
​​
Families in Care provides an independent advocacy and counselling for parents and other family members involved with child protection services across Tyneside. We accept referrals from concerned professionals as well as service users themselves. Please contact us for more details.
 
We also offer weely drop-in group for parents, where they can meet others in similar situation, arrange one-to-one appointment with the member of our team, get advice and share their experiences.
 
Mothers who have very limited or no contact with their chidren can access our adoption self-support group, where in a safe and friendly environment they can talk about their experiences and receive both professional and peer support.
 
Our agency has been also providing successful practice learning opportunities for social work students as well as taking part in training students of family law. Students, Newly Qualified Social Workers and advocates can access our training packages prepared and delivered by our service users and qualified social workers.
 
 
 
Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty and truth and compassion against injustice.
If people all over the world...would do this, it would change the earth.
   
                                                              
                     William Faulkner
Where we work
​​
Families in Care provides direct service on outreach basis in Newcastle upon Tyne. Please contact us for more information.
 
Please contact us if you have an enquiry regarding support for for birth families who live outside of our agency's practice area.
 
 
 
 
 
 Our team
​​
Families in Care employs dedicated qualified social workers and a counsellor. We are grateful for receiving help from our passionate volunteers who dedicate their skills and time to enhance our work in counselling, advocacy and therapeutic activities fields.
They are all passionate people working together to support some of the most vulnerable and isolated members of our society. All members of our team have necessary knowledge and experience in the child protection field and are driven by common values of empowerment, humanity and justice.
 
 
 
'It is a priviledge to work with so inspiring, dedicated and passionate individuals. I believe that our strenght is that here, in Families in Care, our values are our bottom line, our starting and ending point, with the humility in a face of real personal experience and people's struggles being at the core of our ethos.'
